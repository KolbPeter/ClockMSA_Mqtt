# ClockMSA_Mqtt
Aim of the project is to create a micro service architecture style binary clock to run on a Raspberry Pi 3/4 (not three quarters, 3 or 4).
3 of the projects can run separately and communicate with an mqtt protocol. The mqtt configuration file must be present in the corresponding "bin\Debug\net6.0" folder, named "config.json". It must be in this format.
```
{
 "MqttSettings": {
    "BrokerAddress": "your broker address",
    "UserName": "I think this is quite easy to guess",
    "Password": "this one too"
  }
}
```
## Common project
It contains some common code that is used by all projects, trying to keep it short to reduce linking between projects.

## MqttComm
It used to fire up mqtt communication, it is used by all three main projects.

## TimerMqtt
A quite simple project, it will publish a message on every second that contains the current date time and epoch time in seconds.

## ClockMqtt
It subscribe to the TimerMqtt project's message and as a response publish the calculated led strip values.

## DisplayMqtt
Lastly this will display the values to the given pin on the Raspberry.
